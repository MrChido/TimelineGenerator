# TimelineGenerator
This Timeline Generator is designed to set-up the card sets for Temporal Odyssey

Temporal Odyseey has 3 sets of cards representing the timelines of the time wizzards
<br>The past, The Present and The Future.</br>

Durring game set-up each divisision of time contains 3 sub-sets of cards.
This program will decide the sub-set of cards for each faction, randomly.
(it is also a way for me to keep practice on arrays)
